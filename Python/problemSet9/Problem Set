1.Allow the user to enter an amount to invest and an interest rate. This investment yields a return annually for 5 years. Interest is computed to be Interest = principle x rate. For each of the 5 years display the items below. Your program should use a counting loop. Before the loop display the initial investment and the interest rate. After the counting loop, display the total amount of interest earned. Initial Investment $10000.00Interest Rate:	5%Year 	Beginning Balance	Interest	      Ending Balance1		$10000.00		$500.00	$10500.002		$10500.00		$525.00	$11025.003		$11025.00		$551.00	$11576.254		$11575.25		$578.81	$12154.065		$12154.06		$607.70	$12761.76Total Interest Earned: $2762.51Your counting loop has the form:for (y=1; y<=5; y++){	// statements to calculate and display	// beginning balance, interest and ending balance}2.The population of the world increases each year by 4%. In 2007 the population is 6 billion people. Compute and display the population growth for the next 10 years. Output heading should display:Year	Population1	60000000002	6240000000 etc.3.If you borrowed x amount (allow the user to enter) and paid p amount annually, display the new balance each year for y years.4.The following is called the Fibonacci Sequence. 1..1..2..3..5..8..13..21..34..etcUsing a for loop display the first 50 numbers in the sequence. 5.If you start with a penny and then the amount doubles each day, how much will you end up with after 1 year? Display the number of pennies as well as the number of dollars.
